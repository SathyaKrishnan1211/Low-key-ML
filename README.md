# Implementing ML algorithms
This repository is dedicated for the code that I write to implement machine learning algorithms. Although there are highly optimized and readily available libraries, the code here offers a quick peek into the algorithms and they will help you to understand the algorithms better<br><br>
The explanations for some algorithms in this repo are published in [Medium](https://medium.com/@mr.sk12112002)<br>
Many useful scripts will also be uploaded in this repo. Have fun using this repo<br><br>

## Regression models in this repo
* Linear Regression using Gradient Descent.
* Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
* Linear Regression using Mini-batch Gradient Descent.

## Classification models in this repo
* Logistic regression (binary classification).

## Neural Network models in this repo
* Perceptron (single layer)
* Adaline (Single layer)
